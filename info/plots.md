# Plots

## Commands and Mechanics

Run the `/plots` command to view information about the plots on your farm. Plots can hold one tree at a time until it is cut down. The `/plant` command plants the saplings you have to the vacant plots. Each user starts out with **one** plots and can have up to **eight**. You can buy new plots with `/buy plot`.

## Cost

Plots start out very cheap but significantly increase in price as you buy more
