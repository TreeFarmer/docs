## Starting a Tree Farm

To start a tree farm, you must buy a farm using `/start`. You will then be taking through the optional tutorial. You are given $2000 and two saplings. You can plant the saplings with `/plant` which take about a minute to grow depending on your tree. Keep in mind that new saplings cost money. Refer to the [**Trees**](trees.md) article for the cost of saplings since it increases per tree type. You will not be notified when a tree is done, but you can check what trees can be cut with the `/trees` menu and actually cut them with `/cut`. Cutters are limited in efficiency \(actual logs cut\) but can be improved upon upgrading. Read more about cutters [**here**](cutters.md).

## Upgrading a Tree Farm

You can check at any time if you can upgrade your farm by typing `/upgrade farm`. Make sure to only press the confirmation button if you want to upgrade. When you upgrade your farm, you lose all of your Knowledge, Trees, Vehicles, Cutters but keep your money, you're given three saplings and one golden tree.
