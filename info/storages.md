# Storages

## Commands and Mechanics

Run the `/storage` command to view information about all of your storages. You can buy new storages in the order of the list below with `/buy storage` and upgrade vehicles with `/upgrade storage`. When you cut trees down, the logs you received are automatically put into the least filled storage unit. If a storage unit is filled up the extra logs will go to the next least filled storage unit.

## Limitations

Each user can have up to **two** storages on their farm. If all storage units are filled up, the logs you had cut will be wasted, but logs from giveaways will be added into your storage.
