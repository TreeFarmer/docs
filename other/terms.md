# Terms & Privacy

## Terms

By using Tree Farmer you automatically agree to comply with the following terms and will accept punishment given for the broken term\(s\). Not reading the terms and breaking a term is an unacceptable excuse. You also must follow [**Discord's Terms**](https://discord.com/terms) and **BreMea Developments Terms.**

## Privacy

Tree Farmer stores data to keep your progress saved when using the bot. The only data we store from you is your Discord ID \(e.g. 292821168833036288\), not your Discord tag \(e.g. Fyrlex\#2740\). We safely store your Tree Farmer data, such as everything in the **Information** section. We do have a profile/statistic viewer command that allows other registered users \(users who have bought a farm\) that displays your Discord tag, Discord ID, avatar and the rest of the contents from the [**`/profile`**](../info/commands.md#profile) and [**`/stats`**](../info/commands.md#stats) command. You can set your Tree Farmer profile to private at any time with `/hideprofile`.
